# Ideas and Research

A place for me to publish and get feedback on any and all ideas or research that I'm working on.

> Idea shamelessly stolen from [here](https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas), because it's a good idea. 

## [Ideas](https://github.com/dylanlott/ideas-and-research/issues)
Any idea that pops into my head that I want to explore or research more thoroughly will be posted [here](https://github.com/dylanlott/ideas-and-research/issues).

## Papers
More fleshed out ideas will be turned into full blown papers. These will be listed here.

> No papers yet, I'm only just starting.
